            <h2>About</h2>
            <p id="paragraphAbout">Jackson Pollock's art gallery was founded by Leandro Barreto in 2019 in Cologne, Germany. Based in <em>Belgisches Viertel</em> until 2020, the gallery then moved to a 200 m<sup>2</sup> building in <em>Sülz</em>, where it has been promoting a dynamic agenda of exhibitions, special artistic projects, among other actions. Currently, the gallery represents the painter Jackson Pollock and counts with more than 50 pieces of the artist.</p>

               <h2>The artist</h2>
               <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock" target="_blank" id="linkTheArtist">Paul Jackson Pollock (January 28, 1912 – August 11, 1956) was an American painter and a major figure in the abstract expressionist movement. He was widely noticed for his "drip technique" of pouring or splashing liquid househ paint onto a horizontal surface, enabling him to view and paint his canvases from all angles. It was also called all-over painting and action painting, since he covered the entire canvas and used the force of his whole body to paint, often in a frenetic dancing style. This extreme form of abstraction divided the critics: some praised the immediacy of the creation, while others derided the random effects. <br><br> In December 1956, four months after his death, Pollock was given a memorial retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City. A larger, more comprehensive exhibition of his work was held there in 1967. In 1998 and 1999, his work was honored with large-scale retrospective exhibitions at MoMA and at The Tate in London.</a></p>

               <p><a href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/226" target="_blank" id="linkExhibition">The permanent exhibition provides a fresh chance for new generations of artists to come to terms with a legendary figure and enables the broader public to reassess a quintessentially American artist in light of three decades of new scholarship and speculation on his work and often tempestuous life.</a></p>
